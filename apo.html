                    I am very sorry for being so negative.not only that, but I am also sorry for all the things and mistakes that I've done. I failed, or did not consider what you felt when I said those words carelessly. From this day forth, I will do my very best to bottle up all of my negative emotions and thoughts so I can keep them to myself until I can completely forget about them. So please, feel free to do and say anything to me.

                </p>
                <p class="p">
                    You are very special for me, yet I ignored your feelings and almost lost you. So this time, I will devote myself into keeping you. I will be better if it means that you will forgive me. I will stop on thinking only of myself, and will think of what impacts my words would give you. But still, even if I promised to do this, I'm afraid that I won't be able to always keep a check on myself, so if I'm gonna promise you something, it would be to promise you that I will try. And once again, I'm very very sorry.

                                         -well actually, I've found a way to make this part easier, I just decided to use lorem Ipsum as a reference and built the foundation and structure of the website with lorem Ipsum as the contents.

                                        wasn't that hard, just frustrating (i kept having mental blanks) but i'd say debugging was far more frustrating .

                                        got me head achin
                                        While making the index.html, I had no idea how to use flex at that time (which resulted in severe head ache). After aldini taught me how to use flex, it became a lil bit easier and I managed to semi complete the first page.
